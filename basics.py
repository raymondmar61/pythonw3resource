#2. Write a Python program to get the Python version you are using
import sys
print(sys.version) #print 3.5.2 (default, Nov 17 2016, 17:05:23)\n [GCC 5.4.0 20160609]

#3. Write a Python program to display the current date and time.
from datetime import datetime
print(datetime.now()) #print 2017-11-10 20:12:11.688408

#4. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.
from math import pi
def areacircle(radius):
	return pi*(radius**2)
print(areacircle(1.1)) #print 3.8013271108436504

#5. Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.  RM:  skip input().
firstname = "Raymond"
lastname = "Mar"
name = firstname+" "+lastname
print(name[::-1]) #print raM dnomyaR

#6. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.
sampledata = 3, 5, 7, 23
print(sampledata) #print (3, 5, 7, 23)
# sampledatalist = []
# for eachsampledata in sampledata:
# 	sampledatalist.append(str(eachsampledata))
# print(sampledatalist) #print ['3', '5', '7', '23']
print(tuple(map(str,sampledata))) #print ('3', '5', '7', '23')
print(list(map(str,sampledata))) #print ['3', '5', '7', '23']
